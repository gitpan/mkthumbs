mkthumbs - Makes thumbnails in .thumbnails dir. Suitable for gqview etc.

DESCRIPTION
    I use gqview, it makes thumbnails, but very slowly. The program 'epeg'
    makes them incredibly quick at low quality. This uses epeg to create
    thumbnails that will be accepted by gqview so you won't have to wait.

USAGE
    mkthumbs [OPTIONS].. DIRPATH..

       -h help
       -d debug
       -v version

  USAGE EXAMPLES
       mkthumbs ./dir/with/images
